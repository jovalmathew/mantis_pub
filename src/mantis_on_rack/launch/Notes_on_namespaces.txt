Some things to note about the setup of the rack control launch file.

We use the mantis namespace at the top, because the ROS control plugin that we included in the arm URDF file uses mantis as its namespace. 

When looking at the topics that are initialized by ROS, we see that some are /mantis/mantis/... and others are /mantis/express_rack/...

This is due to the fact that mantis/ is the overarching robotNamespace, and mantis/mantis refers to the controllers set up in the mantis YAML file. Similarly, mantis/express_rack refers to the tray controller set up in the express_rack YAML file. 

The top level name mantis also applies to the /joint_states topic. 
In an ideal world, the overarching namespace would be something like mantis_on_rack, and topics would then be:
/mantis_on_rack/mantis/...
/mantis_on_rack/express_rack/...
/mantis_on_rack/joint_states
